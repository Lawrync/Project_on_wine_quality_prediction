##Project_on_wine_quality_prediction


###Business Understanding:
The dataset comprises physicochemical properties and sensory data of red Vinho Verde wine. It offers an opportunity for predictive modeling, posing as a classification or regression task. The objective is to leverage machine learning to identify the physicochemical features contributing to wine quality perception, aiming to uncover insights into factors affecting wine quality.







##Problem Statement:
This project aims to utilize machine learning to predict wine quality based on its physicochemical attributes. The goal is to develop a model that accurately classifies or predicts the quality score, ranging from 0 to 10, using the provided input variables.
